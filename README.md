PermAlmalexia is an Elder Scrolls Online Addon that allows you to run again and automatically some mementos when their effect fades out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following mementos are / should be supported for now:
- Almalexia's Enchanted Lantern
- Finvir's Trinket
- Storm Atronach Aura
- Floral Swirl Aura
- Wild Hunt Transform
- Wild Hunt Leaf-Dance Aura
- Dwemervamidium Mirage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start it, just run the memento, and that's it !
You can stop PermAlmalexia by running the memento again before the effect fades out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: I just realized than a similar Addons was existing already: Memento Refresh but it seems it's not updated anymore.
Feel free to ask about some new memento, I'll see how to add them (Yet, only memento with effects can be handled)
